#TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game
Load, clean, and explore Super Bowl data in the age of soaring ad costs and flashy halftime shows.
In this guided project, I utilized Python to answer questions:
- What are the most extreme game outcomes?
- How does the game affect television veiwership?
- How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
- Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performance?
